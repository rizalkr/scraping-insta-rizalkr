## Overview

This script is designed to clean up files in a specified directory (`folder_path`) by removing all files except those with `.jpg` or `.mp4` extensions. After cleaning, it creates a ZIP archive (`zip_file`) containing the remaining files. This can be useful when organizing and managing large numbers of downloaded Instagram media files.
